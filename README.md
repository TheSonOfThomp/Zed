# ZED

ZED stands for Z-Elevation based Drop-shadows. It's also the correct way to pronounce the last letter in the alphabet ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

ZED creates more realistic-looking overlapping drop-shadows. The way drop-shadows are drawn by default in CSS doesn't take other elements into account. ZED draws shadows that get cast on other elevated elements, creating a more realistic effect.

## Installation
To install ZED, install it from NPM

```
npm i zed-shadow
```

## Usage
```
import Zed from 'zed-shadow'
```
